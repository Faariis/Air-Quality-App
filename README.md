# Air quality app

## Description

Basic Air Pollution App Built in .NET MAUI. We undertook a project to develop a basic air pollution tracking application using .NET MAUI. Using the cross-platform capabilities of .NET MAUI, the app is designed to run seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
The application provides real-time air quality information, presenting users with a user-friendly interface to monitor pollution levels in their vicinity. The APIs fetch live data from environmental monitoring stations, allowing users to stay informed about air quality trends.
The core functionalities include displaying pollutant levels based on the city or town the user enters. Also the color of the air pollutant number changes depending on the level of the air pollution. The intuitive design ensures a smooth user experience and the user can choose between light or dark theme.
Throughout the development, we focused on optimizing performance, ensuring efficient data fetching, and delivering a reliable user interface. The project not only expanded our skills in .NET MAUI development but also underscored the importance of technology in addressing environmental concerns.
